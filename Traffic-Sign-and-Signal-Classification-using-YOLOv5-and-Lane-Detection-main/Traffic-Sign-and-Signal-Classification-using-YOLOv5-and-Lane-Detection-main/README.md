# Traffic-Sign-and-Signal-Classification-using-YOLOv5
In this file we (me and my teammates) use YOLOv5 repository to classify Traffic Signals and Traffic signs.
Also, a program to detect lanes was created by me alone.
I developed the code to classify traffic lights and signs, and detect lanes, but the app to integrate it all was created by my other teammates.

The developed tflite model and weights are also added to the repo.
